I am Jian Wang, a doctoral student at KU Leuven, Belgium. My doctoral study supervised by a Food microbiologist [Prof. Jan F.M. Van Ime](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=s6Jj26IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), KU Leuven. My master study supervised physicist [Dr. Francesco Giglio](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/francescogiglio/), University of Glasgow, UK. My PhD funded by European Union Horizon 2020 Marie-Curie ITN project: [E-MUSEÂ (no.956126)](https://www.itn-emuse.com/) from 2022.05.24-2026.05.23. I am [ESR 11](https://www.itn-emuse.com/phdfellows/jian-wang) of this E-MUSE project with the title: Biology-driven complexity reduction of individual-based models (IbMs).

# Research interests
A microbial community is a tiny society, and when a society forms, social principles emerge. During my PhD, I have been interested in using mathematical/physical models to study microbial social interactions, and I have been trying to build efficiently parsimonious mechanistic models to uncover the fundamental social principles behind their interactions. In the first half of my PhD, I studied microbial competitions, especially how cheating dynamics affect the integrity of quorum sensing systems. During the second half of my PhD, I became gradually attracted to metabolic cooperation among microbes, and developed interest in why individual microbes give up their autonomy and rely on their neighbors for producing essential metabolites. I am working on using mathematical modeling for investigating microbial ecology and evolution.
