I am a doctoral student at KU Leuven, Belgium. My doctoral study supervised by a microbiologist [Prof. Jan F.M. Van Ime](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=s6Jj26IAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), KU Leuven, Ghent, Belgium. My master study supervised a physicist [Dr. Francesco Giglio](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/staff/francescogiglio/), University of Glasgow, Scotland, UK. My PhD (from 2022.05.04-2026.05.23*) funded by European Union Horizon 2020 Marie-Curie ITN project: [E-MUSEÂ (no.956126)](https://www.itn-emuse.com/). I am [ESR 11](https://www.itn-emuse.com/phdfellows/jian-wang) of E-MUSE netowrk with the project title: *Biology-driven complexity reduction of individual-based models (IbMs)*.

##### **Research Interests**
Microbial communities are tiny societies, and when a society forms, social principles emerge. As a *'collaborator'* of individual microbes, my PhD research uses and develops mathematical models to uncover the principles driving microbial social interactions. In the first half of my PhD, I studied microbial 'competition', designing strategies to protect bacterial quorum sensing (QS) system from cheater's disruption. In the second half, I am studying metabolic 'cooperation' among microbes, exploring why individual microbes give up their metabolic autonomy to rely on their neighbors for essential metabolite production. Overall, my research aims to uncover self-organization principles underlying microbial ecology and evolution.

##### **Research Works**
My PhD contributes to improving the applications of individual-based modeling (IbM) by: i) **proposing** a standardized conceptual framework to facilitate build-up; ii) **designing** efficient numerical algorithms to accelerate simulations; iii) **providing** a systematic review to understand bacterial social and spatial interactions; iv) **deriving** simplified yet insightful PDE representations to reduce complexity; and v) **integrating** multiscale datasets to improve reliability, as well as vi) **leveraging** IbM and PDE models to study interesting microbial ecology phenomena.
